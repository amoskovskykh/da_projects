## 1. Survey monkey dataset analysis (processing data from wide to long format + basic aggregations)

In this project, I followed a video by [Shashank Kalanithi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKvWD0f18Pc&ab_channel=ShashankKalanithi) on conducting analysis on raw, wide-format pivoted data. The task statement involved basic cleaning, transforming the data into a long format, and performing basic aggregations.
